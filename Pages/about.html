            Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Mike Love, yes, just like the Beach Boys lead singer. I am originally from Colorado Springs, Colorado, but I am now out in Boston, Massachusetts. I have a deep love for family, sport, sneakers, and Marvel movies. I am a very social person and I love connecting with new people and hanging out with friends. You can catch me on the pitch, roaming the city or the outdoors, in sneaker boutiques, or cheering on my favorite teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love to try new things and get out of my comfort zone. This can be traveling to new and exciting cities or countries, exploring the local food scene, or trying a new sport or activity. My most recent is skateboarding! Through my graduate program, I have developed a love for shoe creation and customization. Please check out some of my fun projects and designs in my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> section!
